## About

Brain Games is a training project, the first out of four to be done as part of Hexlet's course for would-be Python developers. 

It contains five command-line maths quiz-like games. **Brain-calc** is about practicing addition, subtraction and multiplication. In **Brain-even**, the goal is to identify even numbers. **Brain-gcd** requires the user to find the greatest common divisor for two given numbers. **Brain-progression** gives progressions with a missing element to be filled in. And, in **Brain-prime** the user answers if a given number is prime. 

## Installation

Type in the following command: pip3 install --user --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ hexlet-code
